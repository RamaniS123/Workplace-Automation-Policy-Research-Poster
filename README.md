# Human-Centered Autonomous Agent Policy Research

This repository contains my research presented at the **Purdue Spring Research Conference 2025**.  
The project builds on participatory design work originally conducted at the **MIT Media Lab** and is now continuing at Purdue.

## Overview
As autonomous agent (AA) technologies such as **robots, chatbots, and drones** integrate into society, their design and deployment must prioritize **human well-being** and **equity**.

While these technologies offer great potential, they also pose significant social, ethical, and policy challenges. This research explores policies that experts from academia, industry, and policy-making view as essential for **human-centered AA integration**.

## Research Goals
- Identify key policy concerns in AA technology integration
- Explore the social and ethical implications of AA technology adoption
- Provide actionable insights for creating human-centered AA policies

## Methodology
 **8 participatory design workshops** were conducted with a total of **72 participants** from academia, industry, and policy-making:

- **Equitable Design Workshops** (5 workshops, 44 participants)  
  - 2 academic workshops  
  - 2 industry workshops  
  - 1 policy workshop

- **Autonomous Agent Design Workshops** (3 workshops, 28 participants)  
  - 1 robot-focused workshop  
  - 1 chatbot-focused workshop  
  - 1 drone-focused workshop

**Data Collected:** Transcripts from discussions and written outputs, analyzed using a **thematic analysis** approach.
